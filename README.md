## Users Guide

As a user of `ChatOllama`, please walk through the document below, to make sure you get all the components up and running before starting using `ChatOllama`.

### Use with Docker

This is the easist way to use `ChatOllama`.

The only thing you need is a copy of [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml). Please download a copy of `docker-compose.yaml` and execute the command below to launch `ChatOllama`.

```shell
$ docker compose up
```

As `ChatOllama` is running within a docker container, you should set Ollama server to `http://host.docker.internal:11434` in the Settings section, assuming your Ollama server is running locally with default port.

Make sure you initialize the SQLite database as below if you are launching the dockerized `ChatOllama` for the first time:

```shell
# In the folder of docker-compose.yaml

$ docker compose exec chatollama npx prisma migrate dev
```

#### Data Storage with Docker Containers

There are 2 types of data storage, vector data and relational data. See the summary below and for more details, please refer to [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) for the settings.

##### Chromadb

With `docker-compose.yaml`, a dockerized Chroma database is run side by side with `ChatOllama`. The data is persisted in a docker volume.

##### SQLite

The SQLite database file is persisted and mounted from `~/.chatollama/chatollama.sqlite`.

### Use with Git Clone

If you'd like to run with the latest code base and apply changes as needed, you can clone this repository and follow the steps below.

#### Ollama Server

You will need an Ollama server running. You can run it in local environment following the installation guide of [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

By default, Ollama server is running on http://localhost:11434.

#### Install ChromaDB and startup

```bash
#https://hub.docker.com/r/chromadb/chroma/tags

docker pull chromadb/chroma
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```
Now, ChromaDB is running on http://localhost:8000

#### Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm

3. Run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate
```bash
# npm
npm run prisma-migrate

# pnpm
pnpm prisma-migrate

# yarn
yarn prisma-migrate

# bun
bun run prisma-migrate
```

#### Development Server

> Make sure both __[Ollama Server](#ollama-server)__ and __[ChromaDB](#install-chromadb-and-startup)__ are running.

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
